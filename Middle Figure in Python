# Day 29: Middle Figure in Python!
# Today's challenge was about writing a function that takes two strings, joins them, and finds the middle element. 
# If the combined string has a middle element, the function returns it; otherwise, it returns "no middle figures".


# ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented:
# âœ… Removes spaces before joining the strings
# âœ… Checks if the combined string length is odd or even
# âœ… Returns the middle character if length is odd
# âœ… Returns "no middle figures" if length is even

# Example Runs:
# Input: make love, not wars
# Output: e
# Input: good, luck
# Output: no middle figures
